# IMPORTANT
This was my project for my final semester seminar research project at Edinboro University in Spring 2023. I worked on this project as an individualized instruction with Dr. Bennett. The final (I think) version of the paper is available in the `finpap` directory. `latex-stuff` contains the annotated bibliography, and `prop` contains the proposal.

To run the Chudnovsky Algorithm programs `gmp` and `mpfr` are required!

# Summary
This was a simple performance comparison between C/C++ and Rust in the extended sieve of Eratosthenes and the Chudnovsky algorithm. The original data for all the tests are in `finpap` and the original `csv` files with the results are in `script`. Also in same directory is the script used to get the data. To run that script do 
```sh
./timescript.sh
```
THIS WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO RUN AND WILL OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL CSV FILES.

 I consider this project done but I may revisit similar comparisons between the languages in the future.
